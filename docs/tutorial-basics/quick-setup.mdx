# Quick Setup

![](./img/quicksetup-1024.jpg)

## Connect Bus Pirate 5

Connect the Bus Pirate to your computer with a USB C cable.

Bus Pirate 5 currently appears as two USB devices:
- USB CDC class device: an emulated serial port for accessing the user terminal
- USB Mass Storage Device: a disk drive interface for accessing an SD card inserted in the Bus Pirate

These are common device classes and recent operating systems will not request or require a driver. We're living in the future, woohoo!

## Find the serial port

:::tip
Your terminal emulation software will probably detect and list all the available serial ports connected to your computer. If there's more than one serial port, you can connect to each and press ```enter``` until you find the Bus Pirate terminal. You can probably skip this step, but if you need to find the port manually follow the instructions below.

## Fire up a terminal emulator

A terminal emulator is software that connects to the Bus Pirate serial interface and displays the command line. Bus Pirate 5 supports VT100 for a colorful interface with a live view toolbar. A fallback monochrome ASCII mode is also available. Most terminal emulators support VT100, it's been around since the 1970s.
