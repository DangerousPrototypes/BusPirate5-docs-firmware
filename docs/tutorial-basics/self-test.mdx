# Bus Pirate Self-test Guide

![](./img/selftest-1024.jpg)

Every Bus Pirate is lovingly tested by our crack team before it ships, but problems can always occur in transit or over time. The Bus Pirate firmware has a self-test that will help determine if your Bus Pirate is in good working order. 


The detailed self-test is primarily useful in three situations:
- For prototype testing. We may have done a poor job solder paste stenciling or the Neoden 4 did its flick and chase thing. 
- Manufacturing testing. We need to make sure no failed components are on the board before we ship.
- Disaster assessment. Something went wrong while hacking and now a pin doesn't work.

## Setup the self-test

- Disconnect any devices from the Bus Pirate. An external device will interfere with the test and could be damaged by the voltage used on the pins.
- Insert a flash card. If **a formatted and mountable flash card is not inserted the flash card test will fail**. That doesn't mean it's broken, it just means the test couldn't be completed.

:::warning
Disconnect any devices before performing the self-test.
:::
:::caution
The test will work without a flash card, but the flash card section of the self-test will fail.

:::caution
Ensure the Bus Pirate is in HiZ mode before starting the self-test.
:::

- Ensure the Bus Pirate is in HiZ mode. Type ```m``` and press ```enter```. Select option ```1``` to enter HiZ mode.
- Begin the self-test. Type ```~``` followed by ```enter``` in the terminal. Self-test is available in HiZ mode only.
- Press the Bus Pirate button when prompted.

## Self-test steps

Let's break down the self-test step by step.

### System tests

<BrowserWindow>
<br/>
<span className="bp-prompt">HiZ></span> ~<br/>
<span className="bp-info">SELF TEST STARTING<br/>
DISABLE IRQ: OK<br/>
ADC SUBSYSTEM: VUSB  5.03V OK<br/>
FLASH CARD: OK<br/>
PSU ENABLE: OK<br/></span>
</BrowserWindow>

- **DISABLE IRQ** - The Bus Pirate disables all interrupts during the test.
- **ADC SUBSYSTEM** - A test of the analog voltage measurement system and the IO expanders. Can the Bus Pirate change between analog inputs, and does the USB voltage measurement make sense? VUSB should be somewhere between 4.75 and 5.25 volts. Components include the RP2040 connections, 595 IO expander chips, 245 level translator, 4067 analog mux, an op-amp and various passive component connections.
- **FLASH CARD** - Try to mount a flash card. **If no flash card is inserted this test will fail**. Tests the RP2040 connections and flash card socket.
- **PSU ENABLE** - Test the programmable power supply unit. Output is set to 3.3volts with a 50mA current limit, after a delay the voltage is measured. Tests op-amps, comparator, transistors, FETs and several other components in the PPSU.

:::caution
The test will work without a flash card, but the flash card section of the self-test will fail.

### BIO float
<BrowserWindow>
<span className="bp-info">
BIO FLOAT TEST (SHOULD BE 0/&lt;0.2V)<br/>
BIO0 FLOAT: 0/0.03V OK<br/>
BIO1 FLOAT: 0/0.03V OK<br/>
BIO2 FLOAT: 0/0.03V OK<br/>

BIO5 FLOAT: 0/0.03V OK<br/>
BIO6 FLOAT: 0/0.03V OK<br/>
BIO7 FLOAT: 0/0.04V OK<br/></span>
</BrowserWindow>

- **BIOx FLOAT** - The buffered IO pins are set as floating inputs. 
- The 1M ohm pull-down resistors should hold the pins close to ground (logic value 0, <0.2volts). 
- Tests the RP2040, IO buffers, pull-down resistors, and the analog connection to the IO pins. 
- If two adjacent pins are stuck, for example by a solder bridge, the self-test will attempt to determine which pins are effected.

- Tests the PPSU, comparator, transistors, fets, etc.


### Current limit
<BrowserWindow>
<span className="bp-info">

- Tests the PPSU, comparator, transistors, fets, etc.

### Just one button
<BrowserWindow>
<span className="bp-info">
PUSH BUTTON TO COMPLETE: OK<br/>
</span><br/>

</BrowserWindow>

Hopefully you see a happy Bus Pirate with no errors. Your hardware seems to be in working order. 

If you're still having a problem, could it be a firmware bug? Please let us know in the forum.

### Errors

<BrowserWindow>
<span className="bp-info">
FLASH CARD: NOT DETECTED. ERROR!<br/>
...<br/>
ERRORS: 1<br/>
FAIL! :(</span>
</BrowserWindow>

:::caution
The test will work without a flash card, but the flash card section of the self-test will fail.
:::

At this point we haven't see any failures in professionally manufactured boards during prototype runs, but we'll update the docs after the first big batch is tested. 

If your self-test reports errors, we are eager to know. Please post the full self-test results in the forum and we'll have a look.
