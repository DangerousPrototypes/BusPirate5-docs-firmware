# I2C Protocol Commands

## Overview

-   **Bus:** [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2c) (eye-squared-see or
    eye-two-see)
-   **Connections:** two pins (SDA/SCL) and ground
-   **Output type:** open drain/open collector
-   **Pull-up resistors:** always required (2K - 10K ohms)
-   **Maximum voltage:** 5volts

I2C is a common 2-wire bus for low speed interfaces, generally 100KHz, 400KHz and sometimes 1MHz.

**Pull-up resistors**

I2C is an open-collector bus, it requires pull-up resistors to hold the
clock and data lines high and create the data '1'. I2C parts don't
output high, they only pull low, without pull-up resistors there can
never be a '1'. This will cause common errors such as the I2C address
scanner reporting a response at every address. 

Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the ```P``` command.

## Commands

Bus Pirate 5 has global commands available everywhere, and mode commands specific to the currently selected mode. Type ```help``` to see all commands in every mode, or ```help mode``` for the currently available mode commands.

### I2C address search scan

The ```scan``` command in the Bus Pirate I2C mode scans the for device addresses.

You can find the [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) address
for most I2C-compatible chips in the datasheet. But what if you're
working with an unknown chip, a dated chip with no datasheet or you're
just too lazy to look it up?

The Bus Pirate has a built-in address scanner that checks every possible I2C address for a
response. This brute force method is a fast and easy way to see if any
chips are responding, and to uncover undocumented access addresses.

I2C chips respond to a 7bit address, so up to 128 devices can share the
same two communication wires. An additional bit of the address
determines if the operation is a write to the chip (0), or a read from
the chip (1).

#### Scanner details

The ```scan``` command in I2C mode runs the address scanner.

-   For I2C write addresses: the BP sends a start, the write address,
    looks for an ACK, then sends a stop.
-   For I2C read addresses: the BP sends a start, the read address,
    looks for an ACK. If there is an ACK, it reads a byte and NACKs it.
    Finally it sends a stop.

When the I2C chip responds to the read address, it outputs data and will
miss a stop condition sent immediately after the read address (bus
contention). If the I2C chip misses the stop condition, the address
scanner will see ghost addresses until the read ends randomly. By
reading a byte after any read address that ACKs, we have a chance to
NACK the read and properly end the I2C transaction.

<!--

## ACK/NACK management

These examples read and write from the RAM of a DS1307 RTC chip.
```
I2C> [0xd1 rrrr]
I2C START CONDITION
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES**<<<read address** 
READ: 0×07 ACK **<<<sent ACK*[ 
READ: 0x06 ACK 
READ: 0x05 ACK 
READ: 0x04 NACK **<<<last read before STOP, sent NACK** 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C>
```
I2C read operations must be ACKed
or NACKed by the host (the Bus Pirate). The Bus Pirate automates this,
but you should know a few rules about how it works.

The I2C library doesn't ACK/NACK a read operation until the following
command. If the next command is a STOP (or START) the Bus Pirate sends a
NACK bit. On all other commands it sends an ACK bit. The terminal output
displays the (N)ACK status. 
```
I2C> [0xd1 r:5] 
I2C START CONDITION
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES 
BULK READ 0×05 BYTES: 
0×07 ACK 0×06 ACK 0×05 ACK 0×04 ACK 0×03 NACK 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C> 
```
Nothing changes for write commands because the slave ACKs to the Bus Pirate during
writes. Here’s an example using the bulk read command (r:5).
```
I2C>[0xd1 r **<<<setup and read one byte** 
I2C START CONDITION 
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES 
READ: 0x07 *(N)ACK PENDING **<<<no ACK sent yet** 
I2C>r**<<<read another byte** 
ACK**<<<ACK for previous byte** 
READ: 0x06 *(N)ACK PENDING**<<<no ACK yet** 
I2C>] **<<<STOP command** 
NACK **<<<next command is STOP, so NACK** 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C> 
```
A consequence of the
delayed ACK/NACK system is that partial transactions will leave read
operations incomplete.

Here, we setup a read operation ([0xd1) and read a byte (r). Since the
Bus Pirate has no way of knowing if the next operation will be another
read (r) or a stop condition (]), it leaves the ninth bit hanging. The
warning “*(N)ACK PENDING” alerts you to this state.

Our next command is another read (r), so the Bus Pirate ACKs the
previous read and gets another byte. Again, it leaves the (N)ACK bit
pending until the next command.

The final command is STOP (]). The Bus Pirate ends the read with a NACK
and then sends the stop condition.
