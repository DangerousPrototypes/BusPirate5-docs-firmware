# 1-Wire Protocol Commands

## Overview

-   **Bus:** [1-Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire)
-   **Connections:** one pin (OWD) and ground
-   **Output type:** open drain/open collector
-   **Pull-up resistors:** always required (2K - 10K ohms)
-   **Maximum voltage:** 5volts

1-Wire is a common bus for low speed interfaces.

## Configuration options

- None

**Pull-up resistors**

1-Wire is an open-collector bus, it requires pull-up resistors to hold the
data line high and create the data '1'. 1-Wire parts don't
output high, they only pull low, without pull-up resistors there can
never be a '1'. 

Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the ```P``` command.

- 1-Wire requires a pull-up resistor to hold the data line high.
- 1-Wire parts don't output high, they only pull low.
- Without pull-up resistors there can never be a '1'. 
- Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the ```P``` command.

## Syntax

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
| \{ or [ | Issue 1-Wire reset, detect device presence. |
| r       | Read one byte. (r:1…255 for bulk reads)|
| 0b      | Write this binary value. Format is 0b00000000 for a byte, but partial bytes are also fine: 0b1001.|
| 0x      | Write this HEX value. Format is 0x01. Partial bytes are fine: 0xA. A-F can be lower-case or capital letters. |
| 0-255   | Write this decimal value. Any number not preceded by 0x or 0b is interpreted as a decimal value. |
| ```space```| Value delimiter. Use a space to separate numbers. No delimiter is required between non-number values: \{0xa6 0 0 16 5 0b111 0xaF rrrr}. |
| \(#\)   | Run macro, (0) for macro list. |


## Commands

Bus Pirate 5 has global commands available everywhere, and mode commands specific to the currently selected mode. Type ```help``` to see all commands in every mode, or ```help mode``` for the currently available mode commands.

:::tip
Most Bus Pirate commands have help. Add the ```-h``` flag to any command to see the latest available options and usage examples.

Macro ```ds18b20``` reads the temperature from a single 18B20 temperature sensor. The macro uses the skip ROM command, so it will only work with a single DS18B20 device connected.
