<!-- COMMANDS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED IN BP5

### **S** Servo 

`<nl2br>`{=html}1-WIRE\>S Position in degrees (90)\>20 Servo active
(x)\>100 Servo active (x)\>30 Servo active (x)\> 1-WIRE\>S PWM disabled
1-WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html}

S positions the servo arm to the desired angle, 0-180 degrees. The servo
value can be updated as needed, press enter or x to exit. Use \'S\' or
\'g\' again to **disable** the servo.

`<nl2br>`{=html}1-WIRE\>S 90 %:5000 S 180 Servo active DELAY 5000ms
Servo active 1-WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html}

Example of multiple servo positions with delay

Firmware 5.5+

-   [Bus Pirate servo driver
    documentation](Bus_Pirate_servo_driver_documentation "wikilink")

NOTE1: Most servos draw more current than the Bus Pirate can supply!!
Use an external power supply instead.


### **S** BASIC script engine 

`<nl2br>`{=html}2WIRE\> s 2WIRE(BASIC)\> list

65535 bytes. Ready. 2WIRE(BASIC)\>`</nl2br>`{=html} Simple BASIC scripts
can automate repetitive and tedious tasks. Firmware v5.0+. [Bus Pirate
BASIC script reference](Bus_Pirate_BASIC_script_reference "wikilink")

### **<0>** List user macros 

`<nl2br>`{=html}I2C\> \<0\> 1. \<\[0xa1 r:8\]\> 2. \<\> 3. \<\> 4. \<\>
5. \<\> I2C\>`</nl2br>`{=html} User macro \<0\> lists the currently
stored use macros.

### **<#>** Run user macro \# 

`<nl2br>`{=html}I2C\> \<1\> I2C\> \[0xa1 r:8\]`</nl2br>`{=html} Enter
the macro number to recall the command. Press enter to execute.

## Bitwise bus commands

Bitwise commands are only available in certain bus modes.

### **^** Send one clock tick 

`<nl2br>`{=html}2WIRE\> \^ CLOCK TICK 2WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html} Send one
clock tick. \^:1...255 for multiple clock ticks.

### **/ or \\** Toggle clock level high (/) and low (\\) 

`<nl2br>`{=html}2WIRE\> /\\ CLOCK, 1 CLOCK, 0 2WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html}
Set the clock signal high or low. Includes clock delay.

### **- or _** Toggle data state high (-) and low (_) 

`<nl2br>`{=html}2WIRE\> -\_ DATA OUTPUT, 1 DATA OUTPUT, 0
2WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html} Set the data signal high or low. Includes data
setup delay

### **!** Read one bit with clock 

`<nl2br>`{=html}2WIRE\> ! READ BIT: 0 \*pin is now HiZ
2WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html} Send one clock tick and read one bit from the
bus.

On a bus with a bi-directional data line (raw2wire, 1-Wire), the data
pin is left as a high-impedance input after this command.

### **.** Read data pin state (no clock) 

`<nl2br>`{=html}2WIRE\> . 0 \*pin is now HiZ 2WIRE\>`</nl2br>`{=html}
Make the data pin an input and read, but do not send a clock. This can
be used as /.\\ to achieve the same thing as the ! command.

On a bus with a bi-directional data line (raw2wire, 1-wire), the data
pin is left as a high-impedance input after this command.
