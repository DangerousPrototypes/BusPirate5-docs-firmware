# Legacy Binary Mode for Flashrom and AVRdude

:::warning
This documentation is not accurate or complete. It is pending updates.
:::

Raw SPI is a new mode that provides high-speed access to the [Bus
Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/bus-pirate-manual/) SPI hardware.
It was [developed in conjunction with Michal
Ludvig](http://dangerousprototypes.com/2009/10/08/avrdude-patch-program-avrs-with-the-bus-pirate/),
so that [AVRDude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/) can use the Bus Pirate
to program AVR microcontrollers and EEPROMs.

## Overview

Commands are a single byte, except bulk SPI transfers. The Bus Pirate
responds to SPI write commands with the data read from the SPI bus
during the write. Most other commands return 0x01 for success, or 0x00
for failure/unknown command.

## Key points 

-   Send 0x00 to the user terminal (max.) **20 times** to enter the raw
    binary bitbang mode. Pause briefly after sending each 0x00 to check
    if **BBIO1** is returned. Example binary mode entry
    functions
-   Enter 0x01 in bitbang mode to enter raw SPI mode.
-   Return to raw bitbang mode from raw SPI mode by sending 0x00 **one
    time**.
-   Operations that write a byte to the SPI bus also return a byte read
    from the SPI bus.
-   Hex values shown here, like 0x00, represent actual byte values; not
    typed ASCII entered into a terminal.
-   Other values are shown as 8bit binary numbers. Here\'s a
    [binary-\>decimal-\>hex
    converter](http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html).

## Commands

### 00000000 - Enter raw bitbang mode, reset to raw bitbang mode

This command has two purposes. First, send it to the command line
interface 20 times to enter the raw bitbang binary mode. It\'s also used
to exit the raw SPI mode and return to raw bitbang mode.

Send the value 0x00 to the Bus Pirate command line interface **20
times** to enter raw bitbang mode. The Bus Pirate replies \'BBIOx\',
where x is the raw bitbang version number (currently 1).

Once in raw SPI mode (see command 00000001), the 0x00 command returns to
raw bitbang mode. Send 0x00 **once** to return to raw bitbang mode.

In raw bitbang mode, send 0x0F to exit raw bitbang mode and reset the
Bus Pirate.

### 00000001 - Enter raw SPI mode, display version string 

Once in raw bitbang mode, send 0x01 to enter raw SPI mode. The Bus
Pirate responds \'SPIx\', where x is the raw SPI protocol version
(currently 1). Get the version string at any time by sending 0x01 again.

### 0000001x - CS high (1) or low (0)

Toggle the Bus Pirate chip select pin, follows HiZ configuration
setting. CS high is pin output at 3.3volts, or HiZ. CS low is pin output
at ground. Bus Pirate responds 0x01.

### 0001xxxx - Bulk SPI transfer, send/read 1-16 bytes (0=1byte!)

Bulk SPI allows direct byte reads and writes. The Bus Pirate expects
xxxx+1 data bytes. Up to 16 data bytes can be sent at once, each returns
a byte read from the SPI bus during the write.

**Note** that 0000 indicates 1 byte because there\'s no reason to send
0. BP replies 0x01 to the bulk SPI command, and returns the value read
from SPI after each data byte write.

The way it goes together:

-   The upper 4 bit of the command byte are the bulk read command
    (0001xxxx)
-   xxxx = the number of bytes to read. 0000=1, 0001=2, etc, up to
    1111=16

If we want to read (0001) four bytes (0011=3=read 4) the full command is
00010011 (0001 + 0011 ). Convert from binary to hex and it is 0x13

### 0100wxyz - Configure peripherals w=power, x=pull-ups, y=AUX, z=CS

Enable (1) and disable (0) Bus Pirate peripherals and pins. Bit w
enables the power supplies, bit x toggles the on-board pull-up
resistors, y sets the state of the auxiliary pin, and z sets the chip
select pin. Features not present in a specific hardware version are
ignored. Bus Pirate responds 0x01 on success.

Note: CS pin always follows the current HiZ pin configuration. AUX is
always a normal pin output (0=GND, 1=3.3volts).

### 01100xxx - SPI speed

000=30kHz, 001=125kHz, 010=250kHz, 011=1MHz, 100=2MHz, 101=2.6MHz,
110=4MHz, 111=8MHz

This command sets the SPI bus speed according to the values shown.
Default startup speed is 000 (30kHz).

### 1000wxyz - SPI config, w=HiZ/3.3v, x=CKP idle, y=CKE edge, z=SMP
sample

This command configures the SPI settings. Options and start-up defaults
are the same as the user terminal SPI mode. w= pin output
HiZ(0)/3.3v(1), x=CKP clock idle phase (low=0), y=CKE clock edge (active
to idle=1), z=SMP sample time (middle=0). The Bus Pirate responds 0x01
on success.

Default raw SPI startup condition is 0010. HiZ mode configuration
applies to the SPI pins and the CS pin, but not the AUX pin. See the
[PIC24FJ64GA002
datasheet](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en026374)
and the [SPI
section](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39699b.pdf)\[PDF\]
of the [PIC24 family
manual](http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=2575)
for more about the SPI configuration settings.

### 00000100 - Write then read

This command was developed to help speed ROM programming with Flashrom.
It might be helpful for a lot of common SPI operations. It enables chip
select, writes 0-4096 bytes, reads 0-4096 bytes, then disables chip
select.

All data for this command can be sent at once, and it will be buffered
in the Bus Pirate. The write and read operations happen all at once, and
the read data is buffered. At the end of the operation, the read data is
returned from the buffer. The goal is to meet the stringent timing
requirements of some ROM chips by buffering everything instead of
letting the serial port delay things.

  command (1byte)   number of write bytes (2bytes)   number of read bytes (2bytes)   bytes to write (0-4096bytes)
  ----------------- -------------------------------- ------------------------------- ------------------------------

  : Write then read command format

  success/0x01 (1byte)   bytes read from SPI (0-4096bytes)
  ---------------------- -----------------------------------

  : Return data format

1.  First send the *write then read* command (00000100)
2.  The next two bytes (High8/Low8) set the number of bytes to write (0
    to 4096)
3.  The next two bytes (h/l) set the number of bytes to read (0 to 4096)
4.  **If the number of bytes to read or write are out of bounds, the Bus
    Pirate will return 0x00 now**
5.  Now send the bytes to write. Bytes are buffered in the Bus Pirate,
    there is no acknowledgment that a byte is received.
6.  Now the Bus Pirate will write the bytes to SPI and read/return the
    requsted number of read bytes
7.  CS goes low, all write bytes are sent at once
8.  Read starts immediately, all bytes are put into a buffer at max SPI
    speed (no waiting for UART)
9.  At the end of the read, CS goes high
10. The Bus Pirate now returns 0x01, success
11. Finally, the buffered read bytes are returned via the serial port

Except as described above, there is no acknowledgment that a byte is
received.

#### 00000101 - Write then read, no CS

-   Same as the previous command, but CS transitions are NOT
    automated/included.
-   Added for AVRDude
