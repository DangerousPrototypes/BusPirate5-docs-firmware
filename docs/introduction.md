# Bus Pirate 5 Firmware Docs

![](./img/bp5rev10-lit-black2.jpg)  

Bus Pirate 5 is the latest edition of the original universal serial interface trusted by hackers since 2008. 

Can't get a chip to work? Is it the circuit, code, bad part or a burned out pin? The Bus Pirate sends commands over common serial protocols so you can get to know a chip before prototyping. Updated with tons of new features and tools, talking to chips and probing interfaces is more fun than ever!

## RP2040
- Based on Raspberry Pi Foundation RP2040
- 128Mbit flash storage for lots of features
- Firmware developed with the Pico C language SDK

## 8 Buffered IO pins
- 1.2-5volt operating range, 3 state
- Voltage measurement on every pin
- Toggleable 10K pull-up resistors
- 10 pin x 2.54mm main header
- 9 pin x 1.0mm auxiliary header

## Programmable Power Supply Unit
- Current Sense
- Programmable 1-5.0volt output
- Programmable 0-500mA current limit
- Resettable digital fuse
- Protection circuit

## 1Gbit NAND flash storage
- Save global and mode settings
- Appears as a USB disk drive
- Future use for logs, dumps and stand-alone programming

## LCD
- 320 x 240 pixel IPS all direction display
- Pin labels
- Live voltage measurements
- Live current consumption

## 18 RGB LEDs
- Introduction demo
- Party mode

## Just one button
- Escape from modes
- User input for production programming, remote hacking, whatever

## VT100 terminal interface
- Color interface
- Live update toolbar/monitor

## USB bootloader
- Updating is as simple as dragging a file onto the disk

## USB C connector
- ...but limited to the USB speeds supported by the RP2040
