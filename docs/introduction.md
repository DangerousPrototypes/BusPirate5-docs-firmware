# Bus Pirate 5 Firmware Docs

![](./img/bp5rev10-lit-black2.jpg)  

Bus Pirate 5 is the latest edition of the original universal serial interface trusted by hackers since 2008. 

Can't get a chip to work? Is it the circuit, code, bad part or a burned out pin? The Bus Pirate sends commands over common serial protocols so you can get to know a chip before prototyping. Updated with tons of new features and tools, talking to chips and probing interfaces is more fun than ever!
