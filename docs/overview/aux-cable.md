# Auxiliary Cable Kit

![](./img/cable-a.jpg)

A collection of auxiliary cables made from premium soft and flexible silicone coated wire.

- 1 [Auxiliary Connector Cable](https://hardware.buspirate.com/cables/#auxiliary-cable)
- 4 ["Y" Splitter Cables](https://hardware.buspirate.com/cables/#y-splitter-cable) (2 grey, 1 black, 1 red)
- 10 [Jumper Cables](https://hardware.buspirate.com/cables/#jumper-cable) (8 grey, 1 black, 1 red)

The star of the collection is a 9 pin 'SH' style cable that fits the auxiliary connection below main Bus Pirate connector. This cable is handy for connecting external equipment like a logic analyzer - without cramming multiple probe hooks onto a single tiny chip lead. 

This silicone coated wire feels so nice we made a bundle of color coded jumper cables and Y style splitter cables too.

### Auxiliary Connector Cable
