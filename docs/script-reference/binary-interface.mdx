# Scripting Interface

A second USB UART on Bus Pirate 5 is available for binary access and scripting. BBIO1 is a clone of the Bus Pirate v3 interface to support existing software such as AVRDUDE and FlashROM. This backwards compatible interface is very limited because it mimics the hardware features of a 15 year old PIC chip. An updated binary access mode will come soon.

[Example scripts in Python, Perl,
etc](http://code.google.com/p/the-bus-pirate/source/browse/#svn/trunk/scripts).

:::info
Previous Bus Pirates had a fixed pinout and a single ADC probe to measure voltage. BBIO1 supports 5 IO pins: AUX, MOSI,CLK, MISO and CS, as well as a dedicated "ADC PROBE" pin.
:::

## Overview

Bitbang I/O (BBIO1) is the start mode for binary access to the Bus Pirate hardware. BBIO1 gives access to hardware like the ADC and PWM, and includes a simple way to control pins. Pins are all set to input (HiZ) when entering BBIO1.

-   Send 0x00 to the secondary UART interface (max.) **20 times** to enter BBIO1. Check between each byte to see if ```BBIO1``` is returned. The user terminal will lock, but the status bar will still update if enabled.
-   Other protocol modes are accessible from BBIO1.
    0x00 always returns to BBIO1 and prints the version
    string ```BBIO1```.
-   Send 0x0F to exit BBIO1.

## Commands

### **0b00000000** Reset

- Response: ```BBIO1```

This command resets all hardware to a safe state and returns the Bus Pirate into BBIO1 from any other protocol mode. 

This command always returns a five byte
bitbang version string "BBIOx", where x is the current protocol
version (1).

After entering BBIO1, you can enter other binary protocol modes.

### **0b00000001** Enter binary SPI mode

- Response: ```SPI1```
- Not yet ported

### **0b00000010** Enter binary I2C mode

- Response: ```I2C1```
- Not yet ported

### **0b00000011** Enter binary UART mode

- Response: ```ART1```
- Not yet ported

### **0b00000100** Enter binary 1-Wire mode

- Response: ```1W01```
- Not yet ported

### **0b00000101** Enter binary raw-wire mode
- Response: ```RAW1```
- Not yet ported

### **0b00000110** Enter OpenOCD JTAG mode

- Not yet ported

### **0b00001111** Reset Bus Pirate
- Response: ```0x01```

    The Bus Pirate responds 0x01. 
    The hardware and firmware version is printed to the binary mode UART (same as the
    ```i``` command in the terminal) and unlocks the user terminal interface.
    
    Send 0x00 20 times to enter binary mode again.

:::warning
Bus Pirate 5 will not actually reset. Reset is simulated to maintain compatibility with older hardware and software.
:::

### **0b0001000x** Bus Pirate self-tests

- Not yet ported

This command was used for production testing.

### **0b00010010** Setup pulse-width modulation


- Response: ```0x01```
- Not yet ported. The values for the PIC PWM will be vastly different than the RP2040, this will need to be addressed somehow

Configure and enable pulse-width modulation output on the AUX pin.
Requires a 5 byte configuration sequence. Responds 0x01 after a
**complete sequence** is received.

Equations to calculate the PWM frequency and period are in the
[PIC24F output compare
manual](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39706a.pdf).
Bit 0 and 1 of the first configuration byte set the prescaler value.
The Next two bytes set the duty cycle register, high 8bits first.
The final two bytes set the period register, high 8bits first.

### **0b00010011** Clear/disable PWM

- Response: ```0x01```

Clears the PWM, disables PWM output.

### **0b00010100** Single voltage probe measurement

- Response: 2 byte 10bit ADC value

Take a measurement from the Bus Pirate voltage probe (ADC pin). Returns a 2
byte 10bit ADC reading, high 8bits come first. 

To determine the actual
voltage measurement: (ADC/1024)\*3.3volts\*2; or simply
(ADC/1024)\*6.6.

### **0b00010101** Continuous voltage probe measurement 

- Response: 2 byte 10bit ADC values
- Send any character to exit

Sends ADC data (2bytes, high 8 first) as fast as UART will allow. A
new reading is not taken until the previous finishes transmitting to
the PC, this prevents time distortion from the buffer. Added for the
[oscilloscope
script](http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/index.php?topic=976.0).

:::warning
Bus Pirate 5 has a native USB interface that does not have the same predictable timing as a hardware UART. It still waits until the transmit buffer is empty to take the next sample, but this is not as consistent.
:::

### **0b00010110** Frequency measurement on AUX pin
- Response: 4 byte/1 second frequency count
- Not yet ported

Measure frequency on AUX pin. Returns 4byte frequency count (1 second), most significant byte first.

### **0b010xxxxx** Configure pins as input(1) or output(0)
- Response: high/low state of IO pins

Configure pins as an input (1) or output(0). The pins are mapped to
the lower five bits in this order:

0 - 1 - 0 - AUX - MOSI - CLK - MISO - CS

The Bus pirate responds to each direction update with a byte showing
the current high (1)/low (0) state of the pins. This is
useful for open collector I/O modes. The pin states are mapped to
the lower five bits in this order:

X - X - X - AUX - MOSI - CLK - MISO - CS

X = Don't care

### **0b1xxxxxxx** Set on (1) or off (0)

- Response: high/low state of IO pins
- There is a 5us settling delay after updates

The lower 7 bits of the command byte control the Bus Pirate pins, pull-up resistors, and power supply. Bitbang works like a [player piano or
bitmap](http://hackaday.com/2009/09/22/introduction-to-ftdi-bitbang-mode/).
The Bus Pirate pins map to the bits in the command byte as follows:

- 1 - POWER - PULLUP - AUX - MOSI - CLK - MISO - CS

The Bus pirate responds to each update with a byte in the same
format that shows the current high (1)/low (0) state of the pins:

- X - POWER - PULLUP - AUX - MOSI - CLK - MISO - CS

X = Don't care

## PWM Computation

:::danger 
This remains for reference. The old PIC-based Bus Pirate PWM is completely different than the RP2040.
:::

Here is a [Python Script](http://codepad.org/qtYpZmIF) for computing the
PWM for Bus Pirate.

For example, setup PWM with Period of 1msec, 50% duty cycle. Using 1:1
Prescaler.

Modify only the 3 lines:

```python
Prescaler=1 # 1:1
PwmPeriod=1e-3  # 0.1msec
DutyCycleInPercent=.5 # 50%
```

It will output:

```
======================
PwmPeriod: 0.00100000000000000000 sec.
Tcy: 0.00000006250000000000 sec.
Prescaler: 1
PR2: 0x3e7f = 15999
OCR: 0x1f3f = 7999
5 Byte Setup:
1st Byte: 0x00
2nd Byte: 0x1f
3rd Byte: 0x3f
4th Byte: 0x3e
5th Byte: 0x7f
```

Use the 5byte setup to set the PWM.
